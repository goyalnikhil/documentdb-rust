# How to Use Amazon DocumentDB with Rust - A Step-by-Step Guide
## Introduction

This sample project will create a Rust application that executes CRUD operations on an existing Amazon DocumentDB cluster. It will use AWS Secretes Manager to retrieve database credentials and connect to the Amazon DocumentDB cluster.

Project contains a <code>Cargo.toml</code> file with required dependencies and <code>main.rs</code> contains the main source code in Rust programming language.

## Prerequisites

You should have an existing Amazon DocumentDB cluster in your AWS account. Also needed is an EC2 instance that can connect to the DocumentDB cluster. Follow [Getting started with <link>Amazon DocumentDB (with MongoDB compatibility); Part 1 â€“ using Amazon EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/part-1-getting-started-with-amazon-documentdb-using-amazon-ec2/) for detailed steps on creating a cluster and connecting to it from an Amazon EC2 instance.



Finally, you will need to store the database credentials in AWS Secretes Manager. For more information on how to create a secret refer to [AWS Secrets Manager user guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/create_secret.html). The secret name created in this step will be used later in the setup.

## Step 1: Install Rust

On the EC2 instance, Rust should be installed. Follow installation steps at [Install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

## Step 2: Clone this repository

Using below git command clone repository in to the home directory of your EC2 instance.
```
git clone https://github.com/goyalnikhil/documentdb-rust.git
```
Also, download the AWS RDS global certificates bundle and save it your preferred location on your EC2 instance. Full path to this certificate will be needed later on.
```
wget https://truststore.pki.rds.amazonaws.com/global/global-bundle.pem
```
